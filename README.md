Simulating the Impact of Glucose, Fructose, and Sucralose on Brain Activity, Connectivity, and Long-Term Plasticity

## Overview
This project simulates how different sweeteners—glucose, fructose, and sucralose—affect the brain in both the short term (via activity and network connectivity) and the long term (via neuroplasticity and learning performance). Built using literature-backed neuroscience models and visualized in Python, it blends AI-adjacent cognitive simulation, graph theory, and metabolic recovery modeling.

## What This Project Does

### Short-Term Simulation:
- Models BOLD activity in key brain regions (VTA, ACC, Insula)
- Simulates functional connectivity matrices and network graphs
- Uses eigenvector centrality to assess neural “influence” per region

### Long-Term Simulation:
- Visualizes BDNF decline, synaptic degradation, and learning loss over 30 days of glucose exposure
- Simulates 60 days of sugar withdrawal and brain recovery
- Emphasizes how sweeteners trigger activation—but at a cognitive cost

## Key Findings

- **Glucose** powers the brain—then burns it out  
- **Fructose** activates partially, but doesn’t satisfy  
- **Sucralose** fakes sweetness with no neurological payoff  
- **Recovery is possible**, but slow—and never fully complete

## Plots Included

- BOLD signal response curves  
- Functional connectivity heatmaps  
- Brain network graphs using NetworkX
